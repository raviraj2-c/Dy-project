        <strong>1. Use Protection</strong> 
Condoms: Use latex or polyurethane condoms during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Consistent and correct use of condoms greatly reduces the risk of many STIs.
-Dental Dams: For oral sex, use dental dams to prevent the transmission of infections from genital or anal areas.

<strong>2. Get Tested Regularly</strong>
- Routine Testing: Get tested for STIs regularly, particularly if you have multiple sexual partners, have new partners, or engage in unprotected sex. Both partners should be tested and share their results.
-Know Your Status: Ensure you and your partners are aware of each other’s STI status before engaging in sexual activity.

<strong>3. Limit Number of Sexual Partner</strong>
-Mutual Monogamy: Being in a mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has tested negative for STIs can reduce your risk. Limiting the number of partners can also decrease exposure.

<strong>4. Vaccination</strong>
-HPV Vaccine: Get vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV) to protect against the strains that cause genital warts and are linked to cervical and other cancers.
-Hepatitis B Vaccine: This vaccine protects against hepatitis B, which can be transmitted sexually and through blood.
